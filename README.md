# KevsPermissions
## Maintain your server permissions now - performant and lightweight!
KevsPermissions is a lightweight (about 50 KB) permissions management plugin for Spigot and Bukkit Minecraft server. Currently, KevsPermissions only supports a config backend and it's only tested on Spigot 1.11.2, but it should be backward compatible.
